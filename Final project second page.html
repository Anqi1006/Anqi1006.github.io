  <div><h4>In China the company will ask questions about a female candidate’s or employee’s personal life — from relationship status to future plans about marriage and pregnancy — has been a common practice for Chinese companies seeking to avoid costs associated with maternity leave. In some cases, companies have even fired employees for getting pregnant.(<a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/02/china-imposes-hefty-fines-for-sexist-hiring-practices/">Li You</a>)Also according to the history in China, women can’t go out to work, they need stay at home, and do housework.</h4></div>

  <div><h4>Female drivers were much more likely to be injured in a crash than men, because car safety features had been designed for men. The positioning of head restraints, as well as women’s shorter height, different neck strength and musculature, as well as their preferred seating position, meant they were more susceptible to injury. This was also unfair.<a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/03/surprising-stats-about-gender-inequality/">Kate Whiting</a></h4></div>
