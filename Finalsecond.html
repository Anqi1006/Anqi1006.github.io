  <div><h5><ul>Female drivers were much more likely to be injured in a crash than men, because car safety features had been designed for men. The positioning of head restraints, as well as women’s shorter height, different neck strength and musculature, as well as their preferred seating position, meant they were more susceptible to injury. This was also unfair.<a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/03/surprising-stats-about-gender-inequality/">Kate Whiting</a></ul></h5></div>
